## Development Story
I would like to create a database system to manage freelance interpreters and translators. For the last couple of days, I was contemplated as to what genre I want this project to be. I wanted something fun yet interesting, but my mind was not entirely convinced. I kept thinking about a work problem I encountered when I was interning at a interpreting/translation company. Although I was hired as a marketing intern, I was quickly given responsibilities from HR and development departments. One of my responsibilities was to re-establish a strategy in organizing both contractors and clients. The company was using excel to store all the information, but problems arose when the master-list data was downloaded, then information would be updated by different departments, and then be dropped into dropbox. Evidently, this became a huge issue because people were updating different excel spreadsheets and multiple updated versions were created. In other words, there was a lack in version control.
When working with any type of freelancing or contract jobs, having a well-functional and user-friendly managing system is extremely crucial. So this is how the idea for this web application came about.

The api was definitely a working process because it was the first time I was creating
a backend and to do it in within a certrain span of time was a major challenge.
From the last project, one of the things I learned is to start with API. I thought the game logic was going to be more challenging, but boy was I wrong. The API turned out to be the most challenging portion of them all.

For this project, I did not do much styling.The following is a picture of the
schedule I was trying to following.

User Story
