## Development Story
From the last project, one of the things I learned is to start with API. I thought the game logic was going to be more challenging, but boy was I wrong. The API turned out to be the most challenging portion of them all.

For this project, I did not do much styling.


## Unsolved Problem
- decorate the user interface
- UI issues

User Story
1) As an user, I want to be able to register an account.
2) As an user, I want to be able to sign in to this app.
3) As an user, I want to be able to change/update my password.
4) As an user, I want to be able to see, update, add, or remove contractors’ information.
5) As an user, I want to be able to retrieve a contractor’s information depending on my search.
